# Sharaf Connections - Frontend

This repository contains the frontend for the Sharaf Connections site built with Vite, React, TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.

Getting started (local):

```powershell
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>
npm install
npm run dev
```

Project tech stack:

- Vite
- TypeScript
- React
- Tailwind CSS

Notes:

- The project previously included tooling tied to an external service; those references have been removed. If you removed a dependency from package.json, run `npm install` to update the lockfile.
- If you want deployment guidance, tell me where you'd like to host (Netlify, Vercel, static server) and I can add instructions.
